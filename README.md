Predict the possibility of coupon being accepted across a diverse customer dataset 
Will a Customer Accept the Coupon?
Context
Imagine driving through town and a coupon is delivered to your cell phone for a restaurant near where you are driving. Would you accept that coupon and take a short detour to the restaurant? Would you accept the coupon but use it on a subsequent trip? Would you ignore the coupon entirely? What if the coupon was for a bar instead of a restaurant? What about a coffee house? Would you accept a bar coupon with a minor passenger in the car? What about if it was just you and your partner in the car? Would weather impact the rate of acceptance? What about the time of day?
Obviously, proximity to the business is a factor on whether the coupon is delivered to the driver or not, but what are the factors that determine whether a driver accepts the coupon once it is delivered to them? How would you determine whether a driver is likely to accept a coupon?

Overview
The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.


Around 49% of the Coffee house coupons were accepted. 

Customers who went to a coffee house more than 3 times a month were more likely to accept the coupons than those who went to a a coffee house less than 3 times a month.
 
The acceptance rate between drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25 was higher than the acceptance rate of all the other drivers. 

The acceptance rate between drivers who go to bars more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry was approximately 43%. 

The acceptance rate of drivers who go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid was 50% while the acceptance rate of drivers who went to a coffee house at least once a month, were over 30 and drivers who didn't have kids as passengers, were not widowed and went to a coffee house at least once a month was approximately the same
